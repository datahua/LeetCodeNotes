Let's see where solving 600 leetcode problems lead us to!

8.10.2022 

I found 10 leetcode problems daily are only do-able if they are all at **easy** level. So I lower the quota to 5, with meidum and hard level problems involvded. 

So, 10 * 10 + 20 * 5 = 200 -> 200 code problems will be solved in August, some of them will be re-do multiple times to ensure the accuracy as accuracy is more important than quantity.
